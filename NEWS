* What's New with Ski 1.4.0 - 2022-08-19

It's a new fork based on lates 1.3.2 version available. It's new home
is https://github.com/trofi/ski. There are many changes since 1.1.0.
We'll list a few here since 1.3.2:

** https://github.com/trofi/ski is a new Ski home.

** Build is fixed to work with modern glibc, binutils and linux kernel
headers versions.

** More linux syscalls are emulated to at least get basic printf() to
work. More work needs to be done before Ski user emulation can run real
world programs.

** Dropped outdated ski.spec from tarball.

** Dropped ski-config from installed files. Ski does not provide a
stable library interface.

** Dropped dynamic hook loading infrastructure support. Ski no longer
tries to load and execute any libraries via 'SKIHOOK_PATH'. LTDL is
not required anymore.

** libski is not installed any more and is considered an internal
implementation detail of Ski.

* What's New with Ski 1.1.0

... some release entries are skipped ...

** Version numbers have been changed to reflect the old Linux
kernel practice -- x.y.z, where 'x' is major changes, 'y' is
even for stable versions, odd for development/unstable versions,
and 'z' is a patch level.  There will also be x.y.z-d numbers
here and there, for example on the Debian packages; when 'd' 
changes, there's been a change to the way ski is packaged, but
not how it functions.

** Ski has been updated for the latest IA-64 architecture revision
(SDM 2.2).

* What's New With Ski v0.9.81-1

** Ski has been updated for the latest IA-64 architecture 
revision (SDM v2.1). In particular, support for the 16-byte atomic 
operations has been added. 

** The cstack command now works and displays a backtrace of the current 
call-stack. 

** Ski now additionally picks up symbol information from the dynamic 
symbol table section, if it exists. 

** The auto-detection of user- vs. system-mode should now be 
more reliable. If a program is linked for region 0 (as is the case 
for the Linux bootloader, for example), system-mode is assumed 
by default. Auto-detection can be overridden with command line 
options -forceuser and -forcesystem. 

** The Linux version of the X11 app-defaults file (XSki) has been 
updated to add a binding for the backspace key and to default 
the background color to gray. 

** An IA-64 binary of Ski is now available

* What's New With Ski v0.9.77-1

** Merged ski v0943l3  from David Mosberger <davidm@hpl.hp.com> with
ski 0.977. Added new autoconf/automake build environment.

* What's New With Ski v0.943l2

** The "cstack" command is now fully supported and can be used to
show a backtrace.

** Ski now reads the dynamic symbol section of shared libraries.  This
simplifies the debugging of stripped shared libraries, such as glibc,
because the symbolic names for all entry points will be available.

** Ski has been ported to IA-64.  The system call emulation support is
still somewhat preliminary, but already good enough for a wide variety
of applications.  Kernel simulation should work as well as on any other
platform.

* What's New With Ski v0.943l0

** The shmctl() system call now implements SHM_LOCK and SHM_UNLOCK and
semctl() now implements GETALL, SETALL, GETVAL, GETPID, GETNCNT, and
SETVAL in addition to the previously supported commands.

** The X windows accelerator keys now work under Linux.  Specifically,
"Page Up", "Page Down", "Down" and "Up" can be used to scroll around
in the various Ski windows when running under X11.

** The curses interface no longer has the cursor positioning problems
that used to show after commands such as "pf".  This problem was due
to a bug in the Linux ncurses library which has been fixed in
ncurses-5.1.

** Ski is now compatible with the latest stable GNU toolchain (aka,
"Nov 17, 2000" snapshot) and with glibc-2.2.  In particular, Ski now
passes the AT_PAGESZ and AT_CLKTCK auxiliary tags required by
applications linked against glibc-2.2.

** A bug has been fixed in Ski which prevented the kernel "make menuconfig"
from working.

** The system call emulation in Ski has been brought in sync with
Linux v2.4.1.  In particular, Ski now implements the new versions of
stat(), fstat(), lstat() and getdents().  The system calls
pivot_root(), mincore(), and madvise() are not supported under Ski
(they will result in a warning message of the form "unimplemented
system call").

** The Ski simulator has been updated to v0.943 which contains various
bug fixes.
