Prerequisites
=============

If you are instaling from a release tarball you only need:

  * C compiler (like gcc or clang)
  * make tool (like GNU make)
  * curses library (like ncurses)
  * libelf library (like elfutils or libelf)
  * pkg-config
  * awk
  * sed

Some optional features require extra depepdencies:

  * DWARF support:
    * libbfd library (from binutils)
    * unwind library (like libunwind)

To develop Ski you will need a few more dependencies on top:

  * autoconf
  * autoconf-archive
  * automake
  * bison
  * flex
  * gperf

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd ski-1.1.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # unpack the sources
  % cd ski-1.1.1                           # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                            # run the `configure' script
  % make                                   # build

  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                           # install

The Nitty-Gritty
================

The 'configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. For a complete list, type:

  ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                           [ Defaults to /usr/local ]

*  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                           [ Defaults to the value given to --prefix ]

Options can be given to the compiler and linker by setting
environment variables before running configure. A few of the more
important ones:

 CC       : The C compiler to use
 CPPFLAGS : Flags for the C preprocesser such as -I and -D
 CFLAGS   : C compiler flags

The most important use of this is to set the
optimization/debugging flags. For instance, to compile with no
debugging information at all, run configure as:

 CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure           # Bourne compatible shells (sh/bash/zsh)

or,

 setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure  # csh and variants


Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. There are also more
detailed flags to control individual directories. However, the
use of these flags is not tested.
